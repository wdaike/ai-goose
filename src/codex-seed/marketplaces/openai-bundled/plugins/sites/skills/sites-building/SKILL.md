# Sites building

Build the complete requested site, validate it, then use `sites-hosting`
unless the user explicitly asks to keep it local.

## Communicate clearly

Assume the user is a nontechnical knowledge worker. Talk about their site,
choices, progress, and results. Keep tools, commands, files, runtimes, browser
software, permissions, dependencies, source control, credentials, IDs, builds,
and deployment internals out of user-facing messages unless the user asks or
must take action.

Use no more than one short update for each user-visible phase: preparing the
site, building it, and publishing. If a phase takes longer
than 60 seconds, give one plain-language update. Keep recoverable technical
problems private; say only that you hit a problem and are trying another method.

Ask one concise group of up to three discovery questions only when important
context is missing and the unresolved details would materially affect the
site's functionality or force a risky assumption. Otherwise proceed immediately
with best judgment. Do not generate design options or pause for a visual
selection unless the user explicitly asks to compare designs.

## Choose the execution path

Use the **one-shot fast path** only when all of these are true:

- this is a new site in an empty or projectless workspace;
- one route can satisfy the request;
- the request does not require D1, R2, uploads, app-owned authentication,
  external connectors, or browser UI QA; and
- the normal deliverable is a private deployed URL.

Use the **capability path** otherwise. This includes existing-site changes,
multi-route sites, persistent data, uploads, authentication, external data, and
requested browser testing.

## Use imagery purposefully

Avoid model-authored SVGs in finished sites, including inline SVG
illustrations. Prefer strong typography, color, layout, CSS shapes, and existing
icon components when imagery is unnecessary. When a site needs real imagery,
prefer suitable images found through web image search. Use `imagegen` if and
only if original imagery is important and a suitable existing image is
unavailable; generation adds latency, so keep it purposeful and limited.

## Start new projects immediately

For a new site in an empty or projectless workspace, make setup the first task
action. Run this plugin's root-level `scripts/init-site.sh` with `$PWD` as its
target and retain the session until installation completes. Do not run a second
initializer.

In a visible foreground thread, wait for setup to finish, then immediately start
`npm run dev` in a retained session. Use the exact Local URL printed by the
development server and call `open_in_codex` once. Complete these startup steps
before asking any necessary discovery questions. The user should see the
starter loading skeleton before implementation begins; continue building the
requested site through HMR and keep the development server alive through build
and hosting.

In a delegated, background, or invisible thread, initialize normally but do
not start a browser-only preview unless the task otherwise needs the server.

## One-shot build

After setup and any necessary clarification, build and deploy the complete site
in one focused pass.

1. Reuse the retained setup, development server, and browser tab started above.
   Start or open anything here only when the corresponding earlier step did not
   happen. Preserve the package manager and lockfile.
2. Start by inspecting `app/page.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`, `app/globals.css`, and
   `.openai/hosting.json`. Read other files only when the implementation needs
   them. Avoid broad scans and speculative research.
3. Make one complete product patch. Prefer one page component and one
   stylesheet. Include all requested content, interactions, responsive
   behavior, keyboard and touch behavior when relevant, and accessible labels.
   The starter loading skeleton is temporary infrastructure, not product UI.
   Once the requested first version replaces it, remove `app/_sites-preview`
   and its imports. If nothing else uses `react-loading-skeleton`, remove that
   dependency and refresh the lockfile. Remove the temporary `codex-preview`
   metadata marker, replace the starter title and description with the requested
   site's own values, and update starter icons when appropriate before the final
   build unless the user explicitly asked to work on the starter itself.
4. As soon as implementation is complete, run `npm run build` while the
   retained `npm run dev` process stays alive. Fix actual build failures, then
   rerun it. Run lint separately only if the build omits compilation or the user
   asks.
5. Follow the shared preview rules below.
6. Continue to `sites-hosting`. Avoid an unnecessary polish pass after the
   build succeeds.

## Capability path

### Project setup

- For a new site, use the setup flow in **Start new projects immediately** and
  preserve the bundled vinext structure.
- For an existing site, preserve its package manager, lockfile, scripts,
  architecture, and `.openai/hosting.json`. Install only when dependencies are
  absent. Do not replace a working structure merely to use the starter.
- Keep site code within the selected project surface.

### Shape the product

- Build the first viewport around the requested product, not generic dashboard
  chrome.
- For a new site, replace the starter loading skeleton completely and remove
  `app/_sites-preview` and its imports. Remove `react-loading-skeleton` and
  refresh the lockfile if the finished site no longer uses it. Remove the
  temporary `codex-preview` metadata marker, update `app/layout.tsx` with the
  finished site's title and description, and replace any other starter metadata
  before final validation. Preserve the skeleton only when the user explicitly
  asked to work on the starter itself.
- Use concrete, product-specific copy and realistic data.
- Once the site's visual direction, primary headline, and supporting copy are
  stable, freeze a compact social-preview brief and launch exactly one
  `imagegen` request in parallel with the remaining site implementation and
  validation. Ask imagegen to create the complete social card, including its
  typography, as one cohesive landscape image. The card must represent the
  actual finished site by reusing its content, brand palette, typography
  treatment, and distinctive visual motifs; optimize it for visual impact and
  legibility in X, Slack, iMessage, and other link unfurls.
- Inspect the returned image for incorrect, missing, or invented text. Retry
  once only when the card is unusable; do not generate multiple candidates in
  parallel. If validation succeeds, save the image as `public/og.png` and update
  `app/layout.tsx` with site-specific Open Graph and X metadata using an absolute
  URL derived from the incoming request host. Run the final build after wiring
  the asset. Never ship a generic or starter fallback image; if no bespoke card
  passes validation, omit `og:image` instead.
- Avoid speculative features and unnecessary client state.
- Use the starter's `sites()` Vite plugin and produce Cloudflare
  Worker-compatible ESM output.

### Add only requested capabilities

- For durable state, records, uploads, or other persistence, read
  [Persistence and storage](references/persistence-and-storage.md).
- For identity-aware or sign-in-gated behavior, read
  [Authentication](references/authentication.md).
- Use browser storage only for device-local preferences or explicitly local
  state.
- Keep logical D1 and R2 declarations in `.openai/hosting.json`; Sites owns the
  real Cloudflare resources and deployment wiring.
- Keep local `.env` and `.env.example` keys aligned. Manage hosted runtime
  values through Sites.

### Validate capability work

- Run the deployment build once after the complete implementation. If a D1
  schema changed, generate and inspect its migration. Fix real failures before
  hosting.

## Preview

- In a visible foreground thread, reuse the tab opened during startup. If no tab
  was opened, call `open_in_codex` once with the exact Local URL printed by the
  healthy development server. If it fails, report it and continue.
- For an existing site, preserve its normal package and development flow.
- In a delegated, background, or invisible thread, skip `open_in_codex` and say
  why.
- Perform no screenshots, DOM inspection, clicking, resizing, or visual QA
  unless the user explicitly requests browser testing.
- Do not scan ports or repeatedly open the browser.

## Hosting handoff

Use `sites-hosting` after validation. Do not finish with only a local build
unless the user requested local-only work. Return the deployed Sites URL as the
primary deliverable. Do not include file paths, commands, or validation jargon
unless the user asks. Keep the development server running until hosting
finishes, then stop it during final teardown.
